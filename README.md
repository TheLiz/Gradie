# Codewell Challenge: Gradie

From Codewell: Gradie is a simple sign up page, great to practice centering layouts and absolute positioning.

I used a mix of flexbox and grid to put this together. I also deviated a bit to make things more accessible. Darker borders, lack of placeholder text in form fields. 

I think they expected you to position the phone image absolutely, but for this use case it seemed more straight-forward to set it as a background image and position it to the bottom center of the container. The image is pretty small compressed, so I don't feel it's a huge performance issue to go about it this way. Ditto for the gradient background which was provided as an image.
